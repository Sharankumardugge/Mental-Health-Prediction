## **README: Mental Health Prediction Project** 🧠

### **Project Overview** 📊

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting mental health conditions based on various factors. 🧠💪 The goal is to provide early intervention and support to individuals at risk. 🤝

### **Data** 📂

The project utilizes a dataset consisting of Age, Gender, Country, State, Sel_employed, Family_history, Treatment, Work_interface, Tech_company, etc.....

### **Methodology** 🛠️

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** 🧹
   * Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.
   * Normalize or standardize features as necessary.
   * Convert categorical variables to numerical representations.

2. **Feature Engineering:** ⚙️
   * Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.

3. **Model Selection and Training:** 🤖
   * Experiment with different machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines).
   * Train models on the prepared dataset, optimizing hyperparameters as needed.

4. **Model Evaluation:** 📊
   * Assess model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
   * Consider cross-validation or other techniques to prevent overfitting.

5. **Deployment (Optional):** 🚀
   * If applicable, deploy the final model to a suitable environment for real-time predictions.

### **Results** 🎉

* Here we used different number of machine learning algorithms like Random forest, Decision tree, Logistic regression, Support vector machine, Gradient boosting, XG Boost, etc....
* All the algorithms have give accuracy above 85% but the highest accuracy has XG Boost classigier with 95%.

* **Technologies used:** (e.g., Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn)
* **Data visualization techniques:** (e.g., histograms, scatter plots)
* **Model architecture and hyperparameters:** (e.g., number of layers, learning rate)
* **Ethical considerations:** (e.g., data privacy, bias)
